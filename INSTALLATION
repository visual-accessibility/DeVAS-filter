To build the software for Linux:

1.  Install the packages cmake, fftw3-devel, libfftw-3-3, libpng,
    liibpng-devel, libcairo2, and cairo-devel from the appropriate
    repositories.

2.  Run the following commands from the top level of the devas-filter
    directory tree:

      cd build
      cmake ..
      make

3.  Copy the executable files devas-filter, devas-visibility,
    make-coordinates-file, devas-visualize-geometry,
    devas-compare-boundaries, luminance-boundaries, and
    geometry-boundaries from the devas-filer/build to wherever you want
    them.

4.  To remove everything generated in the build process, run the
    following command from top level of devas-filter source directory:

      distclean

---------------------------------------------------------------------
To build the software for MacOS:

1.  Install the package CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>

    Download and unpack Unix/Linux source from
    <http://www.cmake.org/download/>.

    In directory where the CMake source has been unpacked:

      ./bootstrap
      make
      sudo make install

2.  If you want annotated output from devas-compare-boundaries, install
    libcairo following the directions at <https://cairographics.org/>
    and edit the 11th line of CMakeLists.txt in the directory where the
    devas-filter source has been unpacked to turn ON use of the Cairo
    library.

3.  In directory where the devas-filter source has been unpacked, run the
    script:

      Mac-build-script

4.  Copy the executable files devas-filter, devas-visibility,
    make-coordinates-file, devas-visualize-geometry,
    devas-compare-boundaries, luminance-boundaries, and
    geometry-boundaries from the build directory to wherever you want
    them.

5.  To remove everything generated in the build process, run the
    following command from top level of devas-filter source directory:

      distclean

To build the software for Windows:

Currently, the only supported build for Windows targets involves cross
compiling on a Linux systems using Mingw-w64.  This approach can
probably be adapted to MacOS.  A native Windows build is also probably
doable with some work if you have Cmake and Mingw-w64 running on
Windows.

As currently structured, the Windows build produces a directly
executable versions of devas-filter, devas-visibility,
make-coordinates-file, devas-visualize-geometry, and
devas-compare-boundaries.  No installer or special permisions are
required.  On the other hand, you'll need to put devas-filter.exe in
whatever current directory you have for the command window or put the
.exe file in some fixed place and list the folder in your PATH variable.

Text annotation of files output by devas-compare-boundaries is currently
not supported on Windows.

To build the Windows software by cross compiling on Linux:

1.  On the Linux system, install the packages cmake and
    mingw64-cross-gcc.

2.  In directory where source has been unpacked, run the script:

      Windows-build-script

3.  Copy the executable files devas-filter, devas-visibility,
    make-coordinates-file, devas-visualize-geometry,
    devas-compare-boundaries, luminance-boundaries, and
    geometry-boundaries from the build directory to wherever you want
    them.

4.  To remove everything generated in the build process, run the
    following command from top level of devas-filter source directory:

      distclean
